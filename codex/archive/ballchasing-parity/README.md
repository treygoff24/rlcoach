# Ballchasing Parity Archive

This folder contains historical parity-focused plans, docs, and sprint artifacts that are no longer active. The project has intentionally diverged from Ballchasing alignment, and the parity test harness/scripts/fixtures have been removed.

## Contents
- `Plans/` — legacy parity and boost alignment plans.
- `docs/` — parity-oriented documentation (e.g., report plans that used Ballchasing as a baseline).
- `sprints/` — parity and boost-pad authority sprint tickets/checklists.

If parity alignment is ever revisited, treat these as historical references only.
