problem_statement: >
  After completing the boost pad attribution fixes we need to update plans, logs, and public docs so contributors know
  how to reproduce telemetry, interpret quality warnings, and refresh parity fixtures.
non_goals:
  - Do not add new engineering work; this ticket only consolidates documentation and summary logs.
constraints:
  - Summaries must cite parity metrics and open risks discovered during implementation.
  - Ensure new docs reference shared pad catalog and quality-warning semantics.
  - Maintain chronological logs in `codex/logs/` with timestamps and command snippets.

  decision_log: true
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Update the follow-up plan with completion status, referencing merged PRs and remaining risks.
  - [ ] Add a session log summarizing telemetry results, parity deltas, and verification commands.
  - [ ] Refresh `project-overview.md` (or dedicated doc) to explain pad catalog source, quality warnings, and parity harness usage.
  - [ ] Ensure documentation links to scripts/commands added in prior tickets.
