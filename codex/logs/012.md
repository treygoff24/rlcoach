# Ticket 012 â€” Golden Tests and Replay Fixtures

Date: 2025-09-09

Summary:
- Added deterministic golden fixtures and tests that build synthetic reports and compare against stored JSON goldens.
- Documented local replay fixture policy under assets/ with no large binaries committed.

Changes:
- tests/test_goldens.py: synthetic report builder using existing analyzers and event detectors; schema-validated; volatile timestamps stripped for comparison.
- tests/goldens/header_only.json: baseline with empty frames/events.
- tests/goldens/synthetic_small.json: minimal non-empty case with kickoff and a touch.
- assets/replays/README.md: guidance for local-only replays and Git LFS.

Notes:
- Goldens avoid non-determinism by fixing generated_at_utc/started_at_utc and relying on fixed synthetic inputs.
- Kickoff goals_for/goals_against remain 0 due to limited context, consistent with analyzers.

Acceptance:
- Pytest expected to pass with stable golden comparisons.
