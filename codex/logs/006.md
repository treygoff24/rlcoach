# Implementation Log - Ticket 006: Event Detection and Timeline Aggregation

**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Ticket:** 006-event-timeline.md  
**Branch:** feat/gpt5-006-event-timeline  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Implemented event detection and timeline aggregation system to identify significant game events from normalized frame data. The system detects goals, demos, kickoffs, boost pickups, and touches, then aggregates them into a chronological timeline.

## Implementation Details

### Core Module: `src/rlcoach/events.py`

**Event Types Implemented:**
- `GoalEvent` - Ball crossing goal lines with scorer attribution
- `DemoEvent` - Player demolition events with attacker tracking  
- `KickoffEvent` - Match start and overtime kickoff detection
- `BoostPickupEvent` - Player boost collection with pad classification
- `TouchEvent` - Player-ball contact events with outcome classification
- `TimelineEvent` - Unified timeline entry format

**Detection Functions:**

1. **`detect_goals()`**
   - Monitors ball Y position crossing ±5069 units (goal line threshold)
   - Tracks last player touches within 5-second window for scorer attribution
   - Calculates shot speed from ball velocity at goal time
   - Handles edge cases: own goals, no touch attribution

2. **`detect_demos()`**
   - Detects player `is_demolished` state transitions (False→True)
   - Finds nearest enemy player within 500 units as potential attacker
   - Records victim location and team information

3. **`detect_kickoffs()`**
   - Identifies ball at center position (0,0,93.15) and stationary
   - Detects phase (INITIAL vs OT) based on match timestamp
   - Basic role detection from player starting positions
   - Tracks kickoff duration until ball moves significantly

4. **`detect_boost_pickups()`**
   - Monitors player boost amount increases frame-to-frame
   - Classifies BIG (≥80 boost) vs SMALL (≥10 boost) pad types
   - Matches to nearest boost pad locations from field constants
   - Determines stolen status based on field half positioning

5. **`detect_touches()`**
   - Uses proximity threshold (200 units) for player-ball contact
   - Classifies outcomes based on ball speed: SHOT, PASS, DRIBBLE, NEUTRAL
   - Records touch location and ball speed in km/h

6. **`build_timeline()`**
   - Aggregates all event types into chronological timeline
   - Sorts by timestamp, then by event type for stability
   - Preserves event-specific data in unified format
   - Converts to schema-compliant timeline events

### Test Suite: `tests/test_events.py`

**Coverage:**
- 27 tests across all detection functions
- 2+ tests per detector as required
- Edge cases: empty frames, missing data, boundary conditions
- Timeline aggregation and sorting validation

**Test Patterns:**
- Synthetic frame sequences for predictable testing
- Helper functions for creating test frames and players
- Comprehensive boundary testing (goal lines, proximity thresholds)
- State transition validation (demos, boost pickups)

## Technical Specifications

**Detection Thresholds (Deterministic):**
```python
GOAL_LINE_THRESHOLD = 5069.0  # 99% of back wall distance
BALL_STATIONARY_THRESHOLD = 50.0  # Ball speed for kickoff detection
TOUCH_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 200.0  # Player-ball contact distance
BOOST_PAD_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 150.0  # Boost pad matching distance
DEMO_POSITION_TOLERANCE = 500.0  # Max distance for demo attacker
```

**Field Integration:**
- Uses `FIELD.CORNER_BOOST_POSITIONS` for big pad locations
- Uses `FIELD.SMALL_BOOST_POSITIONS` for small pad locations
- Leverages `FIELD.BACK_WALL_Y` for goal line calculations
- Coordinate system: RLBot standard (±4096, ±5120, 0-2044)

## Validation Results

✅ **pytest -q**: All 131 tests pass  
✅ **Event Structure**: Conforms to replay_report.schema.json definitions  
✅ **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input produces same output  
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Handles empty/missing data without crashes  

## Design Decisions

1. **Simple Proximity Detection**: Used distance thresholds rather than complex physics for touch/demo detection
2. **Recent Touch Window**: 5-second window for goal scorer attribution balances accuracy with simplicity  
3. **Boost Classification**: Threshold-based detection (80+ for big, 10+ for small) handles game rounding
4. **Timeline Stability**: Secondary sort by event type ensures consistent ordering for same timestamps
5. **Header-Only Compatibility**: All functions handle missing frame data gracefully

## Integration Points

- **Input**: Normalized `Frame` objects from `normalize.py`
- **Output**: Event objects compatible with schema definitions
- **Dependencies**: Field constants, parser types, standard library only
- **No Network Calls**: All processing is local as per project requirements

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced shot classification (on-target detection)
- Assist attribution for goals
- Advanced kickoff role detection  
- 50/50 challenge outcome classification
- Aerial detection for touches

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/rlcoach/events.py` - Event detection implementation (502 lines)
- ✅ `tests/test_events.py` - Comprehensive test suite (578 lines)

**Branch ready for merge into main.**
