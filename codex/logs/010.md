# Ticket 010 — Challenges & Kickoffs Analyzers

Implemented analyzers and tests:

- `src/rlcoach/analysis/challenges.py`
  - Deterministic contest detection using time (≤1.2s) and space (≤1000 UU) between opposing touches.
  - Outcomes: wins/losses/neutral; first_to_ball percentage.
  - Depth: average absolute Y in meters.
  - Risk index [0..1]: weights — ahead-of-ball 0.4, low-boost (≤20) 0.3, last-man-back 0.3.
  - Player/team scope supported.

- `src/rlcoach/analysis/kickoffs.py`
  - Aggregates kickoff outcomes and approach types per schema.
  - Uses event players to compute `avg_time_to_first_touch_s` and approach counts.
  - Supports team and player scopes; conservative on goals_for/against without team context.

- Integrated into aggregator (`src/rlcoach/analysis/__init__.py`).

- Tests:
  - `tests/test_analysis_challenges.py` — happy path + player scope.
  - `tests/test_analysis_kickoffs.py` — team and player aggregation.

Thresholds are documented and deterministic; all tests pass:
