# Ticket 014 â€” Optional Local UI (Offline Viewer)

**Ticket:** codex/tickets/014-optional-local-ui.md

**Summary**
- Implemented a minimal offline CLI viewer at `src/rlcoach/ui.py` with a `view` subcommand.
- Added docs (`docs/ui.md`) describing usage.

**Usage**
- `python -m rlcoach.ui view examples/replay_report.success.json`

**What It Prints**
- Playlist, map, team size, duration/frames.
- Team scores and player IDs.
- Players (display names with teams).
- A concise per-team metric line (goals, shots, saves, avg_speed_kph, avg_boost).

**Acceptance**
- Manual validation using the provided example JSON renders readable summaries. No network usage.

**Future Work**
- Optional Tauri/Electron desktop UI scaffolding for richer local visualization.
