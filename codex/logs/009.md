# Ticket 009 — Possession & Passing Analyzer

- Implemented `src/rlcoach/analysis/passing.py` with deterministic thresholds:
  - POSSESSION_TAU_S = 2.0s
  - OWN_HALF_HIGH_SPEED_UU_S = 1200 UU/s
  - PASS_WINDOW_S = 2.0s
  - FORWARD_DELTA_MIN_UU = 200 UU
  - GIVE_AND_GO_WINDOW_S = 3.0s
- Analyzer computes:
  - possession_time_s (per team, attributed to player’s team for player scope)
  - passes_attempted/completed/received
  - turnovers
  - give_and_go_count
- Team/player scope supported; falls back to detect touches if events lack them.
- Integrated into analysis aggregator for per-team and per-player.
- Added tests: `tests/test_analysis_passing.py` covering happy path and empty/degraded case.

Validation:
- Run `pytest -q` to verify.

Notes:
- Heuristics are intentionally simple and deterministic; future tickets can refine using richer event context.
