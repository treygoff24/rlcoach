## Action Plan
- Harden ingest integrity gates (real CRC + version extraction) and update coverage.
- Surface richer player metadata from rust adapter into reports while keeping null adapter graceful.
- Expand event pipeline (goal enrichment, kickoff analytics, highlight timeline) to match plan/spec.
- Revalidate schema + full pytest after changes; document remaining gaps for next session.

## What I Did
- Implemented full Rocket League header/content CRC in `ingest`, added version metadata, and refreshed tests/fixtures to cover success + failure paths.
- Propagated parser warnings: rust adapter now reports highlights/player stats → `PlayerInfo` (platform IDs, camera, loadout) and report writer preserves them; null adapter handles CRC degradation without hard errors.
- Enriched goals with header/highlight data (tickmark lead, optional scorers) and started schema support for kickoff lead metrics.
- Added new rust shim helpers (`header_property*`) while enhancing conversion of header properties to Python objects.
- Ran `pytest -q` (full suite) to confirm all 212 tests now pass post-refactor.

## Commands Run
make rust-dev
python - <<'PY' ...> (multiple quick inspections)
pytest tests/test_ingest.py -q
pytest tests/parser/test_rust_adapter_smoke.py -q
pytest -q

- tests/test_ingest.py

## Test & Check Results
- Lint: _not run this session_
- Unit/Integration: `pytest -q` → **212 passed**
- Manual checks: Verified rust adapter header payload (`header_property_keys`, `parse_header`) on `testing_replay.replay` and ensured CLI ingest reports CRC success.

## Next Steps / Follow-ups
- Finish kickoff enrichment (time-to-touch/outcomes) and ensure report serialization mirrors schema changes.
- Extend timeline/event coverage for assists/saves/challenges per plan.
- Audit highlights usage downstream (insights, UI) once schema consumers updated.

## Session Continuation
- Completed kickoff enrichment with role classification, first-touch metrics, and outcome tagging in `events.detect_kickoffs`, and hooked the richer payload into report serialization.
- Added deterministic touch classification (shots, clears/saves, passes) and a new challenge detector feeding both timeline entries and the challenges analyzer; updated schema/tests to require the new event stream.
- Refreshed golden fixtures, sample report JSON, and schema validation data to include `challenges`, and reran the full test suite (`pytest -q`) now at **216 passed**.
