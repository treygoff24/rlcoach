# Log 2025-09-26 Doc Refresh
## Action Plan
- Audit existing docs for outdated references and usage guidance gaps.
- Refresh core documentation (README, CLAUDE guide, Markdown plan) to match the implemented pipeline.
- Relocate the implementation plan to the Plans folder and record the work.

## What I Did
- Reviewed README, agent guides, and design notes to catalog mismatches.
- Updated README with feature rundown, Rust adapter notes, consolidated documentation links, and removed a stale parser doc reference.
- Rewrote CLAUDE.md sections to reflect the active codebase and current development commands.
- Normalized the Markdown composer plan example command and moved the implementation plan into `codex/Plans/`.

## Commands Run
- mv codex/docs/rlcoach_implementation_plan.md codex/Plans/rlcoach_implementation_plan.md
- apply_patch (README.md, CLAUDE.md, codex/docs/json-to-markdown-report-plan.md)

## Files Touched
- README.md
- CLAUDE.md
- codex/Plans/rlcoach_implementation_plan.md
- codex/docs/json-to-markdown-report-plan.md

## Test & Check Results
- Lint: not run (documentation-only changes)
- Unit/Integration: not run (documentation-only changes)
- Manual checks: Verified updated links and commands resolve locally

## Next Steps / Follow-ups
- Consider expanding documentation with a contributor quickstart once analyzer telemetry stabilizes.
- Regenerate Markdown/JSON samples after upcoming telemetry fixes to keep docs aligned.
