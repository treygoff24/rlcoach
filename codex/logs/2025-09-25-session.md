# Session Log – 2025-09-25

## Context Recap
- Brought rust parser (`rlreplay_rust`) up to 0.10.7 boxcars to resolve `TAGame.PRI_TA:TotalGameTimePlayed` decode error.
- Rebuilt the adapter wheel and reinstalled locally (`pip install …/rlreplay_rust-0.1.0-cp38-abi3-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl`). Network frames now decode (8,621 frames at ~28.7 Hz).
- Observed downstream report still wildly off vs ballchasing (goals 14/16, shots 47/127, etc.). Root cause traced to stale goal detector emitting duplicates. Also fundamentals, boost, and player stats still zero-ish because analyzers were not aligned with header data.

## Changes Implemented
1. **Goal Detection** (`src/rlcoach/events.py`)
   - Replaced naive position-only loop with split logic:
     - `_detect_goals_from_header` builds goal events directly from header tick marks (7 goals for this replay) and maps names → `player_id`s.
     - `_detect_goals_by_position` retained as fallback when header lacks tick marks.
   - Added assist heuristics using last touches within a 5 s window and highlight lead timing support.

2. **Player Header Stats Preservation**
   - `PlayerInfo` now stores the raw header `stats` dict (normalized to plain values).
   - Fundamentals analyzer uses these stats to override goals/assists/shots/saves/score if available, keeping report in lockstep with official scoreboard while still reporting event-derived demos/touches.

3. **Boost Pickup Matching**
   - Expanded pad matching radius (big pads +150 uu, small +110 uu) and introduced short-term position history per player (~0.4 s window) so high velocity pickups still map to a pad. This reduced “unmatched pad” misses dramatically, although boost collection totals still diverge from Ballchasing (needs more tuning).

4. **Rust Adapter Maintenance**
   - Patched `parsers/rlreplay_rust/src/lib.rs` to reset ball state if its actor despawns and reappears; prevents frozen ball after goals.
   - Rebuilt wheel and reinstalled after each adapter tweak.

5. **Report Regeneration**
   - Re-ran `python -m rlcoach.cli report-md Replay_files/0925.replay --out out --pretty` multiple times to inspect impact. Latest run shows team fundamentals matching header (Blue 5 G/3 A/9 Sh; Orange 2/2/7) while other sections still deviate (boost totals, possession, challenges, etc.).

## Current State & Outstanding Issues
- **Boost economy**: Despite improved pad matching, collected/stolen amounts remain far from Ballchasing (should be 4724/813 vs current 852/204 for Blue). Need deeper frame-by-frame integration with `BoostPickupEvent` quantization and ensure boost timeline integration (perhaps mis-scaling due to 33 starting boost?)
- **Movement/positioning**: Aggregates still off (e.g., time slices not respecting 302 s match). Possibly because timeline includes pre-kickoff timestamps (starts at 3.59 s) and continues past end; may require normalizing timestamps to kickoff start and using header duration rather than raw timeline span.
- **Possession/challenges**: Counts (turnovers 51/52, contests 25) way higher than Ballchasing; touch detector likely still over-firing. Needs dedupe or quality filters.
- **Kickoff metrics**: Approach distribution still nonsense (DELAYS only). Booster history suggests we’re capturing kickoff boost but analyzer heuristics need rework.

## Next Steps for Incoming Agent
1. **Boost Economy Alignment**
   - Instrument `_analyze_player_boost` to compute integrated boost levels vs pickups and verify per-frame boost deltas. Compare against Ballchasing team blue/orange numbers using Python notebook or ad-hoc script.
   - Confirm initial spawn boost (33) is handled and that we aren’t double-counting charges (grant_count increments may need to gate pickup recognition).

2. **Timeline Normalization**
   - Inspect `build_timeline` output: timestamps currently start ~3.59 s (kickoff after warmup). Consider subtracting initial timestamp so kickoff = 0 and clamp end to last header frame or duration. Re-run fundamentals/movement to see if durations align (should match 302 s from header/CSV).

3. **Touch/Challenge Cleanup**
   - Review `detect_touches` thresholds; consider using ball velocity + player relative velocity to drop dribble spam. Align contest counts with Ballchasing (target ~mid-30s?).

4. **Kickoff Analyzer**
   - After boost telemetry confirm, revisit `_classify_kickoff_role`/`_update_kickoff_state` to derive approach types (speedflip/cheat) and ensure boost usage tracked.

5. **Regression Harness**
   - Once metrics align, capture new golden JSON/MD for this replay and build comparison harness vs Ballchasing outputs.
