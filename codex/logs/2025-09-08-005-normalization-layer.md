# Engineering Log: Ticket 005 - Normalization Layer Implementation

**Date:** 2025-09-08  
**Ticket:** [005-normalization-layer.md](../tickets/005-normalization-layer.md)  
**Branch:** `feat/gpt5-005-normalization-layer`  
**Developer:** Claude Code Agent

## Overview

Successfully implemented the normalization layer for rlcoach, providing a bridge between parser outputs and analysis modules. The implementation converts raw replay data into standardized timeline format with measured frame rates, RLBot coordinate system, and unified player identities.

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`src/rlcoach/field_constants.py`** - New module
   - RLBot field constants (±4096, ±5120, 2044)
   - Vec3 data structure with basic operations
   - Field utility functions (bounds checking, thirds, distance calculations)
   - Boost pad positions for large corner and small pads

2. **`src/rlcoach/parser/types.py`** - Extended
   - Added Vec3, PlayerFrame, BallFrame, Frame data structures
   - Frame provides player lookup and team filtering utilities
   - Maintained compatibility with existing Header and NetworkFrames

3. **`src/rlcoach/normalize.py`** - New core module
   - `measure_frame_rate()`: Robust FPS measurement using median delta
   - `to_field_coords()`: Multi-format coordinate transformation with bounds checking
   - `normalize_players()`: Player identity unification across header/frame data
   - `build_timeline()`: Complete timeline construction with error resilience

4. **`tests/test_normalize.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
   - 27 test cases covering all functions and edge cases
   - Integration tests with realistic replay data simulation
   - Malformed data handling and graceful degradation verification

### Key Technical Decisions

**Frame Rate Measurement:**
- Uses median delta between timestamps to handle frame drops
- Supports multiple timestamp formats (timestamp, time, dict, object attrs)
- Clamps results to reasonable range (1-240 FPS)
- Defaults to 30 FPS for unmeasurable sequences

**Coordinate System:**
- Transforms various input formats (Vec3, tuples, dicts, objects)
- Enforces RLBot standard bounds with tolerance for edge cases
- Gracefully handles invalid input by returning origin
- Maintains compatibility with existing schema coordinate_reference

**Player Normalization:**
- Prioritizes header player information as source of truth
- Creates aliases for frame-based player IDs when needed
- Handles missing platform_id with positional fallback
- Preserves team assignments across data sources

**Timeline Construction:**
- Sorts frames chronologically regardless of input order
- Extracts ball and player states from multiple data formats
- Handles header-only mode with minimal valid timeline
- Skips malformed frames without stopping processing

### Error Resilience

The implementation follows the project's degradation policy:

- **Malformed timestamps**: Skipped with continued processing
- **Invalid coordinates**: Converted to origin (0,0,0)
- **Missing player data**: Creates minimal valid player frames
- **Header-only input**: Generates basic timeline structure
- **Network parsing failures**: Falls back gracefully

### Performance Considerations

- Zero-copy Vec3 operations where possible
- Efficient timestamp extraction with early type checking
- Chunked frame processing (samples first 10 for player mapping)
- Minimal object creation in hot paths

## Testing Results

All 104 tests pass including:
- 27 new normalization-specific tests
- Full regression testing of existing functionality
- Edge case coverage for malformed data
- Integration testing with realistic replay simulation

Key test categories:
- Frame rate measurement (8 tests)
- Coordinate transformation (8 tests)  
- Player normalization (4 tests)
- Timeline building (6 tests)
- End-to-end integration (1 test)

## Schema Compliance

The implementation aligns with the JSON Schema requirements:
- `recorded_frame_hz` calculated from actual frame timing
- `coordinate_reference` matches RLBot constants (4096, 5120, 2044)
- Player and team data preserved from parser inputs
- Quality warnings propagated through pipeline

## Next Steps

This normalization layer enables:
1. **Analysis modules** can consume standardized Frame objects
2. **Consistent coordinates** across all downstream processing
3. **Reliable frame timing** for time-based calculations
4. **Unified player identity** for cross-frame tracking

The implementation is ready for integration with analysis engines (tickets 007-010) and provides the foundation for all metrics calculations.
