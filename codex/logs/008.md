# Implementation Log - Ticket 008: Movement/Speed and Positioning/Rotations Analyzers

**Date:** 2025-09-09  
**Developer:** Claude Code  
**Ticket:** 008-analysis-movement-positioning.md  

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive movement/speed and positioning/rotation analyzers for the RLCoach replay analysis system. Both analyzers follow the established patterns from existing analyzers and provide schema-compliant metrics with deterministic calculations.

## Files Implemented

### Core Analyzers
- **`src/rlcoach/analysis/movement.py`** - Movement and speed analysis
- **`src/rlcoach/analysis/positioning.py`** - Positioning and rotation compliance analysis

### Comprehensive Tests  
- **`tests/test_analysis_movement.py`** - 14 test cases covering all movement scenarios
- **`tests/test_analysis_positioning.py`** - 20 test cases covering all positioning scenarios

### Integration
- **`src/rlcoach/analysis/__init__.py`** - Updated to wire up new analyzers

## Implementation Details

### Movement Analyzer Features
- **Speed Bucket Classification**: Time tracking in slow (≤500 UU/s), boost (500-2300 UU/s), and supersonic (≥2300 UU/s or flagged) ranges
- **Height Analysis**: Ground (≤25 UU), low air (25-500 UU), high air (>500 UU) time tracking
- **Powerslide Detection**: Angular velocity-based detection with minimum duration thresholds
- **Aerial Detection**: Height and duration-based aerial identification 
- **Frame Duration Logic**: Proper time attribution with estimated duration for final frames
- **Team Aggregation**: Sum of individual player metrics for team analysis

### Positioning Analyzer Features
- **Field Occupancy**: Time in offensive/defensive halves and thirds with team-relative calculations
- **Ball Relationships**: Behind/ahead ball percentages with threshold-based detection
- **Role Detection**: First/second/third man classification based on ball distance relative to teammates
- **Distance Calculations**: Average distances to ball and teammates in meters
- **Rotation Compliance**: 0-100 scoring system with flag detection for violations
- **Team Perspective**: Proper field orientation handling for blue vs orange teams

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Deterministic Thresholds**: Fixed constants for consistent results across runs
2. **Frame Duration Handling**: Each frame gets duration until next frame; final frame gets estimated duration  
3. **Team-Relative Coordinates**: Blue defends negative Y, orange defends positive Y
4. **Rotation Compliance**: Simple violation-based scoring with specific flags
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Empty result handling for missing data scenarios

## Test Coverage

### Movement Tests (14 cases)
- Empty frames handling
- Speed bucket classification accuracy
- Ground vs air height classification  
- Powerslide detection with rotation data
- Aerial detection with height/duration thresholds
- Team aggregation correctness
- Frame duration handling with variable intervals
- Single frame analysis
- Complex multi-pattern scenarios

### Positioning Tests (20 cases)
- Field half/thirds classification for both teams
- Behind/ahead ball calculations
- Distance calculations (ball, teammates)
- Role detection (first/second/third man)
- Team analysis aggregation
- No teammates handling (1v1 scenarios)
- Rotation compliance scoring and flag detection
- Complex multi-frame positioning scenarios

## Performance Considerations

- Single-pass frame iteration for efficiency
- Pre-calculated speed and distance values
- Efficient teammate distance calculations
- Minimal memory allocation during analysis
- O(n) complexity where n is frame count

## Schema Compliance

Both analyzers return data structures that exactly match the JSON Schema definitions:
- All required fields present
- Proper data types (integers, floats, percentages)
- Value ranges respected (percentages 0-100, non-negative counts)
- Deterministic field ordering

## Edge Cases Handled

- Empty frame sequences
- Single frame analysis
- Missing player data
- No teammates scenarios (1v1)
- Variable frame intervals
- Final frame duration estimation
- Demolished player states
- Supersonic flag overrides

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Frame Duration Logic**: Resolved complex timing attribution ensuring each frame contributes appropriate duration
2. **Team Coordinate Systems**: Implemented proper blue/orange field perspective handling
3. **Role Detection**: Accurate first/second/third man classification with distance-based logic
4. **Test Consistency**: Aligned test expectations with deterministic frame duration approach
5. **Rotation Compliance**: Balanced scoring algorithm with meaningful violation detection

## Testing Results

All 34 tests pass successfully:
- **Movement Tests**: 14/14 passing
- **Positioning Tests**: 20/20 passing  
- **Integration Tests**: Verified through analysis aggregator

## Future Enhancements

While not in scope for this ticket, potential improvements could include:
- Historical rotation compliance tracking (detect when players leave proper positions)
- Advanced powerslide pattern recognition  
- Team coordination metrics (spacing, rotation timing)
- Field heat map generation for positioning analysis
- Machine learning-based positioning recommendations

## Conclusion

The movement and positioning analyzers are production-ready with comprehensive test coverage and full schema compliance. They integrate seamlessly with the existing analysis pipeline and provide the foundation for advanced coaching insights in the RLCoach system.
