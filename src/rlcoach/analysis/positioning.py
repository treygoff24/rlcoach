"""Positioning and rotation analysis for Rocket League replay data.

This module computes positioning and rotational metrics from frame data:
- Field occupancy: time spent in halves, thirds, and zones
- Ball relationship: behind/ahead percentages and distances
- Role detection: first/second/third man classification
- Rotation compliance scoring with flag detection
- Team positioning analysis and coordination metrics

All calculations use deterministic thresholds and frame-by-frame
analysis for consistent results.
