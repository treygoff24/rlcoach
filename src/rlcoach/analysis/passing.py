"""Possession and passing analysis for Rocket League replay data.

This module computes deterministic possession and passing metrics using
synthetic touch sequences and frame data:
- Possession time: team in control if last touch by team within Ï„ seconds
  and ball not traveling toward own half at high speed.
- Passing: attempts/completions/received using teammate touch pairs within
  a fixed time window and forward field progress toward opponent net.
- Turnovers: possession changes between teams on consecutive touches.
- Give-and-go: A->B completed pass followed by B->A completed pass within
  a short window.

Deterministic thresholds (documented):
- POSSESSION_TAU_S: 2.0 seconds window for recent touch control
- OWN_HALF_HIGH_SPEED_UU_S: 1200 UU/s defines "moving hard toward own half"
- PASS_WINDOW_S: 2.0 seconds between teammate touches to qualify
- FORWARD_DELTA_MIN_UU: 200 UU minimum forward progress for a completed pass
- GIVE_AND_GO_WINDOW_S: 3.0 seconds between the two passes

All calculations are local-only and reproducible across runs.
