"""Boost economy analysis for Rocket League replay data.

This module computes boost usage and collection metrics:
- BPM (Boost Per Minute) and BCPM (Boost Collected Per Minute)
- Time spent at 0 and 100 boost
- Overfill and waste calculations
- Boost pad collection tracking
- Stolen boost analysis

All calculations use frame-by-frame analysis with event correlation
for comprehensive boost economy assessment.
