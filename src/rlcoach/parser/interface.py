    This interface defines the contract that all parser adapters must implement.
    Adapters can specialize in different parsing approaches (e.g., Rust-based,
    Haskell-based, or Python-based parsers) while providing a consistent interface.

    The interface supports graceful degradation: if network frame parsing fails,
    adapters should still attempt to provide header-only information with
    appropriate quality warnings.
